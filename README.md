# ECG-Wave-Detection-Anomaly-Detection

**Problem Statement**

- ECG machines risk warranty nullification with third-party IoT interfaces.
- Limited solutions for patientsâ€™ vital signs information extraction.
- ECG machines operate using paper-based systems, lacking digital data capabilities.

**Project Highlight**

- Utilizing camera and computer vision to extract vital information.
- Using the extracted information for better healthcare and assisting medical personnel.

**Project Steps**
- ***YOLO Training & Prediction***: Train YOLO (You Only Look Once) model on annotated ECG monitor dataset for object detection and obtain predictions on all images.
- ***Annotate and Augment Data***: Annotate and augment data using tools like Roboflow to improve model training and performance.

- ***Cropping with Bounding Box***: Identify and crop regions of interest within the ECG monitor images based on high-probability bounding boxes.
- ***Edge Detection & Boundary Detection***: Apply edge detection techniques to identify wave edges and boundaries within the ECG monitor images.
